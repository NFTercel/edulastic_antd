# Components Guidelines

While writing components we try to follow the [Container/Presentational components pattern](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

Presentational Components

- Are concerned with how things look.
- May contain both presentational and container components\*\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own.
- Often allow containment via this.props.children.
- Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores.
- Donâ€™t specify how the data is loaded or mutated.
- Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props.
- Rarely have their own state (when they do, itâ€™s UI state rather than data).
- Are written as functional components unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations.
- Examples: Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List.

Container Components

- Are concerned with how things work.
- May contain both presentational and container components\*\* inside but usually donâ€™t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles.
- Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.
- Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components.
- Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources.
- Are usually generated using higher order components such as connect() from React Redux, createContainer() from Relay, or Container.create() from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand.
- Examples: UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList

## Life Cycle Methods ðŸ’“ ðŸš´

- Make api calls and related actions (dispatch actions that make async calls) in `ComponentDidMount`.
- Do cleanup actions in `ComponentWillUnMount`.
- No other lifecycle methods are recommended.
